Script for rigctl

to access the radio in programs you will use the local host 127.0.0.1:xxxxx.  this will work with multiple programs at the same time.  
be sure to make the byid the byid for your radio. 
this will work with other makes and models by changing the radio number, baud rate, and byid.  
you can change your port numbers in the program most common used for the rigctrl is 4530-4540 for the telnet side use 14530-14540.  by chosing the same last 4 digits it will make things more organized if you have mulitple radios.
